Hi, I am a graduate student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am a research assistant in the Dependable Computing Systems Lab [(DCSL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) supervised by [Prof. Saurabh Bagchi](https://saurabhbagchi.us) in the School of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE), and in the Innovatory for Cells and Machines Lab [(ICAN)](https://schaterji.io/research/) supervised by [Prof. Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/) in the [ABE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE) Department. Previously, I graduated with a B.Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur [(IIT KGP)](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) with a major in [E&ECE](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC) and a minor in [CSE](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/).

At Purdue, my work focuses on developing and enhancing collaborative machine learning algorithms, such as Federated Learning and Decentralized Learning, with an emphasis on addressing their vulnerabilities. My efforts are geared towards making these algorithms both more secure and more efficient.
