Hi, I am a graduate student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am a research assistant in the Dependable Computing Systems Lab [(DCSL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) supervised by [Prof. Saurabh Bagchi](https://saurabhbagchi.us) in the [ECE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) Department, and in the Innovatory for Cells and Machines Lab [(ICAN)](https://schaterji.io/research/) supervised by [Prof. Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/) in the [ABE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE) Department. Previously, I graduated with a B.Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur [(IIT KGP)](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) with a major in [E&ECE](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC) and a minor in [CSE](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/).

My work at Purdue mainly involves exploring collaborative machine learning algorithms like Federated learning, and their vulnerabilities. I have been focussing on making these algorithms more secure and efficient.
